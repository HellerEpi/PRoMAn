\usage{
create_project(
  project_code = NULL,
  project_name = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  path = NULL,
  use_gui = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_code}{Unique project identifier (e.g., "P3.1")}

\item{project_name}{Optional human-readable project name (defaults to project_code)}

\item{description}{Optional project description}

\item{path}{Full path where project should be created. If NULL and use_gui=TRUE,
opens folder selection dialog. If NULL and use_gui=FALSE, throws error.}

\item{use_gui}{Whether to use GUI for folder selection when path=NULL (default: TRUE in interactive sessions)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the project path. Also sets the working directory
to the new project via set_project().
}
\description{
Creates a standardized PRoMAn project directory with all required folders,
tracking markers, and a .proman configuration file. Can be used interactively
with GUI folder selection or programmatically with specified path.
}
\details{
This function creates a complete project structure including:
\itemize{
\item Project root directory with .proman configuration file
\item data/ (with source/ and cleaned/ subdirectories)
\item r_programs/ for R scripts
\item personal_notes/ (with reading/ and figures/ subdirectories)
\item sources/ for reference materials
\item old/ for archived files
}

Each folder contains a hidden .proman_(foldername) marker file that allows
PRoMAn to track folders even if they are moved within the project.

The .proman file in the project root contains:
\itemize{
\item Project metadata (code, name, description)
\item Folder registry for fast path lookups
\item Project status and statistics
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Interactive mode with GUI folder selection
create_project("P3.1", project_name = "COVID Analysis")

# Programmatic mode with specified path
create_project("P3.1",
               project_name = "COVID Analysis",
               description = "Analysis of COVID-19 data",
               path = "/Desktop/projects/P3.1")

# Force non-GUI mode (will error if path not specified)
create_project("P3.1", use_gui = FALSE)  # Error!
create_project("P3.1", path = "/projects/P3.1", use_gui = FALSE)  # Works!
}

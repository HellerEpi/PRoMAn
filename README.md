# PRoMAn
PRoMAn is an R package that grew out of personal tools.  In its current state, it can help with file organization and data management, rudimentary workflows, project organization and logging of work, saving fallback statuses of projects, and contains a system for helping with the creation of scientific products, which I call "Blitzschreiben."
